- Improve layout/look
- Add scrollbox to Flexbox (if possible)
- Allow resizeable (keep panel on right same width)
- Increase download speed
- Cache images (likely on startup, or able to refresh)
- Consider just naming and leaving files on file system
- Don't download to FILE, go straight to Image (if speed improved enough)
- Clean up code according to a style guideline
